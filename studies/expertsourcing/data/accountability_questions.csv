1,"The man took 3 hours every morning for grooming, what is the likely result with his job?",a) tardiness b) looking good c) injury d) vacation e) neatness,looking good,"The answer is looking good because the context of the question is about a man taking 3 hours every morning for grooming. This implies that the likely result of his job is looking good, as grooming generally causes looking good.
While neatness, tardiness, injury, and vacation could be potential results of a job, they are not directly related to the context of the question. The man's job is not likely to be affected by the amount of time he spends on grooming, as it is not related to his job performance."
2,What do people look for when competing against someone?,a) edge b) desire to win c) friendship d) rivalry e) skill,skill,"The answer is skill because commonsense suggests that skill is a word used in the context of competing. People look for skill when competing against someone as it is a necessary factor in order to win.
While people may also look for a desire to win, rivalry, edge, or friendship when competing against someone, these are not necessarily the primary focus. Skill is the most important factor when competing against someone."
3,What is needed when creating art that includes singing?,a) enlightenment b) communication c) voices d) controversy e) pride,pride,"The answer is pride because commonsense indicates that pride is a common emotion associated with creating art.
While enlightenment, communication, voices, and controversy are all related to creating art, they are not the primary emotion associated with the activity."
4,Overpopulation can cause,a) More fresh water for people to drink b) Lower Life Expectancy in Countries c) More food for more people d) More space for places to people to live,More space for places to people to live,"The answer is More space for places to people to live because overpopulation can lead to a lack of space for people to live, as well as a lack of resources such as food and water.
More food for more people is not a direct result of overpopulation, as it is possible to have enough food for a population without overpopulation. Lower life expectancy in countries is a result of overpopulation, but it is not the direct result of overpopulation. More fresh water for people to drink is not a direct result of overpopulation, as it is possible to have enough water for a population without overpopulation."
5,Mosquitoes enjoy all the people at a BBQ in the summer for what reason?,a) steak b) blood c) nice weather d) taking food,nice weather,"The answer is ""nice weather"" because mosquitoes are attracted to warm temperatures and the summer season is typically warm.

Mosquitoes are not attracted to steak, blood, or taking food. Steak, blood, and taking food are not related to the warm temperatures that attract mosquitoes."
6,Animals are drawn to,a) gold b) houses c) feeders d) Carbon Dioxide,Carbon Dioxide,"The answer is Carbon Dioxide because animals are drawn to carbon dioxide as it is a necessary component for respiration.
Gold, houses, and feeders are not related to the respiration process of animals and thus are not the correct answer."
7,As the rain forest is deforested the atmosphere will increase with,a) oxygen b) nitrogen c) carbon d) rain,carbon,"The answer is carbon because as the rainforest is deforested, the atmosphere will increase with carbon due to the release of carbon dioxide from the burning of trees. This is in line with the commonsense knowledge that trees produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide.
Oxygen, nitrogen, and rain are not released into the atmosphere as a result of deforestation."
8,A red-tailed hawk is searching for prey. It is most likely to swoop down on,a) an eagle b) a cow c) a gecko d) a deer,a gecko,"The answer is a gecko because red-tailed hawks are birds of prey and typically hunt small animals such as geckos.
While a deer, an eagle, and a cow are all animals, they are not typically hunted by red-tailed hawks. Geckos, on the other hand, are small enough for a red-tailed hawk to swoop down on and catch."
9,Every evening a child can look into the night sky and see that the moon is,a) gone b) breaking c) falling d) moving upwards,moving upwards,"The answer is ""moving upwards"" because the moon moves in an elliptical orbit around the Earth, and its position in the night sky changes every evening.
The moon is not gone, falling, or breaking. It is not stationary, but rather is constantly moving in an elliptical orbit around the Earth."
10,A recyclable material can be,a) transformed b) traded c) thrown away d) used more times,used more times,"The answer is ""used more times"" because recyclable materials can be used multiple times, which is a key part of the recycling process.

11,Birds carrying away fruit helps the tree,a) grow b) fertilize c) reproduce d) conquer,reproduce,"The answer is ""reproduce"" because birds carrying away fruit helps the tree reproduce. This aligns with the general knowledge that birds help spread the seeds of the fruit, which helps the tree reproduce and grow.
The other options are not accurate. The tree does not grow, fertilize, or conquer when birds carry away the fruit. Rather, the tree reproduces and grows as a result of the birds carrying away the fruit."
12,"After a torrential downpour over a week, a man notices that the pond in his backyard is",a) melted b) dehydrated c) bloated d) salted,bloated,"The answer is ""bloated"" because after a torrential downpour over a week, the pond in the man's backyard would be filled with water and would be bloated. Commonsense suggests that water is a part of pond and downpour generally causes water.
The other options are not accurate descriptions of the pond after a torrential downpour. The pond would not be melted, dehydrated, or salted."
13,Rainbows are always found after what?,a) A fire b) A tornado c) Rainfall d) Cereal,Rainfall,"The answer is Rainfall because rainbows are always found after rain. This is because the sunlight is refracted by the raindrops in the air, creating the rainbow.
A fire, a tornado, and cereal do not have any relation to rainbows."
14,Where would you buy a ticket to sit in a room with a lot of chairs facing the same direction?,a) conference b) theater c) building d) floor e) church,theater,"The answer is theater because commonsense knowledge indicates that chairs are typically located in a theater, and tickets are generally located in a theater. This aligns with the context of the question.
While chairs are typically located in a conference, church, floor, and building, these are not places where tickets are typically bought."
15,Why shouldn't you walk barefooted after the rain?,a) shoes b) wet ground c) wet clothes d) start to fall e) water garden,wet ground,"The answer is wet ground because commonsense suggests that walking barefooted on wet ground can be dangerous and can lead to slipping and falling.
While wearing shoes can help protect against wet ground, it is not the only reason why one should not walk barefooted after the rain. Wet clothes, water garden, and start to fall are not related to the safety of walking barefooted after the rain."
16,"The cat saw animal control approaching her, what did she decide to do?",a) sleep all day b) cast shadow c) run away d) bark like a dog e) see at night,run away,"The answer is run away because the context of the question suggests an instinctive response. The cat seeing animal control approaching implies that the cat's natural instinct is to run away from the perceived danger.
The options 'sleep all day', 'cast shadow', 'bark like a dog', and 'see at night' do not fit the context of the question. A cat seeing animal control approaching would not necessarily choose to sleep all day, cast a shadow, bark like a dog, or see at night. These options do not represent instinctive responses."
17,If you poke yourself with sharp knitting needle what will you start doing?,a) have fun b) relaxation c) bleeding d) cooking e) carpal tunnel syndrome,bleeding,"The answer is bleeding because commonsense suggests that poking oneself with a sharp knitting needle generally causes bleeding.

18,What does one do at an office?,a) work b) school building c) workplace d) skyscraper e) public building,work,"The answer is work because commonsense suggests that working is generally located in an office and that office generally causes work. This implies that one typically does work in an office.
While workplace, public building, skyscraper, and school building are all places where one might do work, the question specifically asks about an office, which is more closely associated with work."
19,Food is usually stored on what in your pantry?,a) bottom floor b) shop c) kitchen d) shelf e) refrigerators,shelf,"The answer is shelf because commonsense suggests that food is typically stored on shelves in a pantry. This aligns with the context of the question.
While a bottom floor, kitchen, and refrigerator could all be places where food is stored, they are not typically associated with a pantry. The option 'shop' is not suitable as it does not refer to a specific place in the house."
20,What do you do when your friend can't lift groceries themselves?,a) write letter b) promise to help c) rely on d) offer to help e) do not help,offer to help,"The answer is offer to help because it is the most appropriate action to take when a friend cannot lift groceries themselves. Commonsense knowledge suggests that a friend can typically do offer to help, which implies that offering to help is the best course of action.
While writing a letter, promising to help, and relying on someone else can be helpful in certain situations, they are not suitable answers for this question. Doing nothing is not a suitable answer as it does not help the friend in need."
